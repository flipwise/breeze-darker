# Breeze Darker (KDE Plasma Color Scheme)

This is a fork of Breeze Darker which inverts the view and background colors, creating a more darker all-around experience. 

There are some minor tweaks to colors, most notably highlight color is now not as bright.

To make the most of the color scheme, make sure to use a color-aware Plasma theme such as Breeze (not Breeze Dark) or Arc-Color.
